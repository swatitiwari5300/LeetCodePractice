# 📘 LeetCode & DSA Practice

Welcome to my personal repository where I consistently practice **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** through **LeetCode** and other platforms. This is part of my journey to sharpen problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews.

## 📌 What You’ll Find Here

- ✅ Solutions to **LeetCode** problems (categorized by topic & difficulty)
- 🚀 Classic **DSA problems** (arrays, trees, graphs, DP, etc.)
- 💡 Code snippets in **Java** (or other languages I explore)
- 📒 My notes, explanations, and optimized approaches
